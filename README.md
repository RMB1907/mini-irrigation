# mini-irrigation
This Arduino project reads soil moisture levels using an analog and digital soil sensor and automatically controls a water pump via a relay module. If the soil is too dry (below a set threshold), the pump is activated. Real-time sensor values and pump status are displayed in the Serial Monitor.
